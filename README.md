# ADK Multiagent System with MCP Integration

This project implements a multiagent system using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) that interacts with the planning system through MCP (Model Context Protocol).

## Overview

The system features specialized agents for different development roles, each with access to role-specific MCP servers. The Coordination Agent serves as the central orchestrator, delegating tasks to specialized agents and managing overall workflow.

### Agent Architecture

- **Coordination Agent**: Central orchestrator with access to all specialized agents as tools
  - Delegates tasks to appropriate specialized agents based on the nature of the request
  - Manages project plans through the planning system
  - Provides unified interface for users

- **Specialized Agents**:
  - **Backend Developer Agent**: Server-side code implementation with filesystem and documentation access
  - **Frontend Developer Agent**: Client-side implementation with UI-specific MCP integrations
  - **Designer Agent**: Visual and UX design with design-specific tools
  - **Research Agent**: Information gathering with web search capabilities
  - **Tester Agent**: Quality verification with Playwright integration
  - **Plan Optimizer Agent**: Plan structure improvement and organization

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ with pip
- Node.js 16+ (for MCP servers)
- Google AI API Key
- Planning System MCP Server
- Context7 MCP Server (for documentation)
- Filesystem MCP Server (for code files)
- Playwright MCP Server (for testing)
- Web Search MCP Server (for research)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/talkingagents/agent-planner-agents.git
cd agent-planner-agents
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:

```bash
# Copy the example configuration file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your actual values
# IMPORTANT: Update all paths to point to the actual MCP server directories
```

5. Test the MCP connections:

```bash
# Test a specific MCP server
python test_mcp_tools.py --server planning

# Test all MCP servers
python test_mcp_tools.py --server all
```

## Configuration

The `.env` file contains important configuration values required for the system to work:

- **GOOGLE_API_KEY**: Your Google AI API key (required)
- **PLANNING_MCP_PATH**: Absolute path to the planning MCP server directory (required)
- **PLANNING_API_URL**: URL of the planning system API (default: http://localhost:3000)
- **PLANNING_API_TOKEN**: API token for the planning system (required)
- **CONTEXT7_MCP_PATH**: Path to the Context7 MCP server (required for documentation access)
- **FILESYSTEM_MCP_PATH**: Path to the filesystem MCP server (required for code file access)
- **PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_PATH**: Path to the Playwright MCP server (required for testing)
- **WEBSEARCH_MCP_PATH**: Path to the web search MCP server (required for research)

- **Suggest improvements**: "Suggest improvements to our development workflow"

## Delegation Architecture

The Coordination Agent has access to all specialized agents as tools. When a user sends a request, the Coordination Agent:

1. Analyzes the request to determine which specialized agent should handle it
2. Delegates the task to the appropriate agent
3. Receives the response from the specialized agent
4. Formats and returns the final response to the user

This delegation pattern allows each agent to focus on its specific domain while providing a unified interface for users.

## MCP Integration

This system leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized communication between AI agents and external systems:

- **Planning System MCP**: For plan and task management
- **Context7 MCP**: For accessing documentation
- **Filesystem MCP**: For code management
- **Playwright MCP**: For automated testing
- **Web Search MCP**: For research and information gathering
